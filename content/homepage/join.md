There are several ways to participate in the Hackathon:

* by building a science team;
* by joining a science team;
* by exploring in loose collaboration with others.
* work on your own.

Over the course of the hackathon it is conceivable that you do all of the above.

#### Building a Science Team

To buid a team you need to define and document a scientific question, propose specific analyses, and coordinate the activities of people who join your team.  To propose a team just make a merge request that adds a description of your team following the example on the [Science Teams page](./scienceteams.md).

In the case that you have an idea that overlaps with ideas already being used to build a team, contact the team-lead of the existing team and explore the possibility of joining the team, or jointly coordinating the team.  

#### Joining a Science Team

Joining a team is easy, simply review the list of existing teams on the [Science Teams page](./scienceteams.md) and sign up for one that interests you.  Depending on how ambitious the various projects are it might be possible to join more than one team, but we ask that you affiliate with one team, and audit other teams of interest.

That means that you can either sign up to *affiliate* with or just *audit* a team.

#### Exploring in loose collaboration

For those who don't want to build a team, or join a team, it is still possible to explore the data with others.  For this purpose a collaborative environment will be set up for those not affiliated with a team to exchange with others about what they are doing.  In addition some tasks will be suggested that help new users get started with their own analysis.

#### Work on your own

Experienced users might have a clear idea of what they want to accomplish during the Hackathon.  However, because not all models will be hosted on all nodes, working on your own may preclude you from applying your analysis to all of the models.  For that you would need to build a team.
