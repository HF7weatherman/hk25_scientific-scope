# Science Teams

Across the different nodes participants will be setting up science teams. These teams will address specific topics as proposed by the team lead, and attempt to engage others in joint analysis. These are open for participants at all nodes to join. 

Teams are given a shortname based on the initials of the lead PI as shown in the example below. Each will also have an associated repo on github with the same shortname.  The repo  will serve as the primary basis for communication among team members.  Mattermost channels, markdown pads, and video-conference links may also serve as supplemental forms of communications, as indicated on the repo README.md

## Joint EarthCARE Analysis (hk25-st1)

[EarthCARE](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/earthcare) is a satellite, developed by ESA, JAXA and NICT and is the sixth satellite choosen as part of ESA's Earth Explorer Programme.   It was launched on 28 May 2024, and be completing its first year in orbit at the time of the Hackathon.  It has unusual capabilities for measuring clouds, aerosols, and radiation.

In this team we will analyze both EarthCARE data and the participating models along virtual EarthCARE swaths, with an initial focus on tropical deep convection as analyzed by EarthCARE, aircraft, ships and ground stations during the [ORCESTRA campaign](http://orcestra-campaign.org/), i.e., over the Tropical Atlantic in the time-period between 10 August and 30 September.

**Coordination**: Bjorn Stevens (bjorn.stevens@mpimet.mpg.de)

#### Sketch of initial activities:
* extract model output along selected orbit frames
* post-process output using model simulators
* extract analagous EarthCARE frames and data from reanalyses.
* perform composit analysis of various quantities.


## Joint Analysis of the Climate Simulated for Greenland and Antarctica (hk25-st2)

Mass loss of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is an important contributor for current and future sea level rise. To properly drive the surface mass balance calculations in ice sheet models, a realistic simulation of precipitation and surface temperatures is crucial. Regional modeling studies suggest that higher resolution of the atmospheric models driving ice sheet models improves the simulation of processes occurring at the steep margins of the ice sheets, making km-scale global models a promising tool for future coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice sheet modelling as planned for example in the [TerraDT](https://terradt.eu/) project.

In this team we want to compare the simulated surface meteorology over Earthâ€™s two big ice sheets among the global km-scale models of this hackathon and with reanalysis data and observations to assess how suited the models are to drive ice-sheet models.

#### Sketch of initial activities:
-	extract model output for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets
-	produce precipitation and temperature maps
-	compare annual cycles for regional means and selected locations
