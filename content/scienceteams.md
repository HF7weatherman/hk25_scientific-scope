Across the different nodes participants will be setting up science teams. These teams will address specific topics as proposed by the team lead, and attempt to engage others in joint analysis. These are open for participants at all nodes to join. 

Teams will are given a shortname based on the initials of the lead PI and each will have an associated repo on github the the same name and this  will serve as the basis for communication among team members.

## Joint EarthCARE Analysis (hk25-st1)

EarthCARE is a satellite, developed by ESA, JAXA and NICT and is the sixth satellite chose ans part of ESA's Earth Explorer Programme.   It was launched on 28 May 2024, and be completing its first year in orbit at the time of the Hackathon.  It has unusual capabilities for measuring clouds, aerosols, and radiation.

In this team we will analyze both EarthCARE data and the participating models along virtual EarthCARE swaths, with an initial focus on tropical deep convection as analyzed by EarthCARE, aircraft, ships and ground stations during the ORCESTRA campaign, i.e., over the Tropical Atlantic in the time-period between 10 August and 30 September.

#### Lead: Bjorn Stevens (bjorn.stevens@mpimet.mpg.de)

#### Example workflow:
* extract model output along selected orbit frames
* post-process output using model simulators
* extract analagous frames from EarthCARE archive and from ERA or JMA reanalyses.
* perform composit analysis of various quantities.
